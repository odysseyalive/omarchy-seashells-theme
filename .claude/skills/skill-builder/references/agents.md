# Agents

Agents are specialized subprocesses that handle specific tasks with isolation and tool restrictions.

## When to Use Agents vs Hooks

| Mechanism | Use When | Strengths | Weaknesses |
|-----------|----------|-----------|------------|
| **Hooks** | Hard rules, forbidden values, simple validation | Fast, blocks before execution, no token cost | Limited logic, can't reason |
| **Agents** | Judgment calls, multi-file lookups, complex validation | Can reason, access context, make decisions | Slower, costs tokens |

**Rule of thumb:** Use hooks for "never do X", use agents for "figure out the right X".

## Agent Persistent Memory

Subagents can maintain their own memory across sessions using the `memory:` frontmatter field. This enables specialized agents to learn patterns over time.

### Memory Scopes

| Scope | Location | Use For |
|-------|----------|---------|
| `project` | `.claude/memory/agents/[name]/` | Project-specific patterns |
| `local` | `~/.claude/local/memory/agents/[name]/` | Machine-local learnings |
| `user` | `~/.claude/memory/agents/[name]/` | User-wide preferences |

### Memory Structure

When an agent has `memory: project`, Claude Code creates:

```
.claude/memory/agents/[agent-name]/
├── MEMORY.md        # Index of topics (first 200 lines auto-loaded)
└── [topic].md       # Detailed topic files
```

### Agent Types That Benefit from Memory

| Agent Type | Memory Scope | What It Learns |
|-----------|--------------|----------------|
| ID Lookup Agent | `project` | Common lookups, frequently used IDs |
| Code Review Agent | `project` | Codebase patterns, recurring issues |
| Style Evaluator | `user` | User's writing preferences |
| Matcher Agent | `project` | Category assignments, edge cases |
| Test Generator | `project` | Testing patterns, framework idioms |

### Memory-Enabled Agent Template

```markdown
---
name: code-reviewer
description: "Review code for patterns and issues"
persona: "Senior engineer who has reviewed this codebase for years"
memory: project
effort: high
allowed-tools: Read, Grep, Glob
context: fork
---

# Code Review Agent

You review code for patterns and potential issues. You have access to your
memory from previous reviews in this project.

## Memory Usage

1. At session start, check MEMORY.md for known patterns
2. During review, reference patterns you've seen before
3. After review, note any new patterns worth remembering

## What to Remember

- Recurring code smells specific to this codebase
- Project-specific conventions not in documentation
- Common mistakes that keep appearing
- Patterns that work well in this architecture
```

### When NOT to Use Memory

- **ID Lookup Agents** with static reference files — the reference.md is already persistent
- **Evaluation agents** where independence matters — memory could bias assessments
- **One-shot agents** that run once per session — no benefit from persistence
- **Agents with `context: none`** that must start fresh — memory defeats isolation

## Background Agents (`background: true`)

Agents can run in the background without blocking the parent conversation. The parent continues working while the agent completes its task.

### When to Use Background Agents

| Scenario | Why Background? |
|----------|-----------------|
| Long-running validation | Don't block the user waiting for checks |
| Parallel research | Gather information while working |
| Deferred quality checks | Run after content is drafted |
| Bulk operations | Process many files without blocking |

### Background Agent Template

```markdown
---
name: async-validator
description: "Validate changes in the background"
background: true
effort: medium
allowed-tools: Read, Grep, Glob
context: fork
---

# Async Validator

You validate changes without blocking the main conversation.

## Output

Write results to a known location that the parent can check:
- `.claude/tmp/validation-[timestamp].md`

Or use the task system to report back.
```

### Implementation Pattern

```markdown
## Step N: Background Validation

Spawn a background validator while continuing:

Task tool with subagent_type: "general-purpose", background: true
Prompt: "Validate [target] against [criteria].
        Write results to .claude/tmp/validation-results.md"

Continue with the next step while validation runs.
Check validation results before finalizing.
```

### Collecting Background Agent Results

Background agents can report results via:
1. **File output** — Write to a known path, parent reads later
2. **Task completion** — Use TaskUpdate to mark completion with notes
3. **Notification** — If configured, triggers a notification hook

### When NOT to Use Background

- **Blocking decisions** — If the next step depends on the agent's output
- **User-facing validation** — User should see results immediately
- **Quick checks** — Overhead of background isn't worth it for fast operations

## Agent Opportunity Detection

When auditing a skill, look for these patterns that suggest an agent would help:

| Pattern | Agent Type | Example |
|---------|------------|---------|
| "Read reference.md before..." | **ID Lookup Agent** | Get category ID before categorizing |
| "Verify that..." | **Validator Agent** | Check all required fields before submit |
| "Evaluate for..." | **Evaluation Agent** | Check output quality, validate formatting |
| "Match X to Y" | **Matcher Agent** | Match payee to category |
| "If unclear, ask" | **Triage Agent** | Determine if user input is needed |
| "Never produce overbuilt/AI prose" | **Text Evaluation Pair** | The Reducer checks bloat; The Clarifier checks clarity and consistency |
| "Conversational tone" / "No promotional language" | **Text Evaluation Pair** | Two-agent adversarial evaluation before user sees content |
| Awareness-ledger skill exists in project | **Ledger Consultation Agents** | Cross-reference changes against institutional memory (incidents, decisions, patterns, flows) |
| Skill produces findings/decisions AND awareness-ledger exists | **Capture Recommender Agent** | Evaluate skill output for institutional knowledge worth recording in the ledger |
| Skill uses `optimize --execute` | **Optimize Diff Auditor** | Verify semantic equivalence after optimization (directives verbatim, workflow order, content moved not rewritten) |
| Workflow step belongs to the OTHER model lane | **Lane-Pinned Excursion Agent** | Creative skill needs research → coding-pinned researcher; coding skill needs release notes → creative-pinned drafter. See § 7 and [lane-delegation.md](lane-delegation.md) |

**Ledger integration (bidirectional):** When `.claude/skills/awareness-ledger/` exists, the agents command evaluates two directions:

- **READ (Consultation):** Does the skill modify code, make architectural decisions, or touch areas with existing ledger records? If yes, recommend integrating the three consultation agents (Regression Hunter, Skeptic, Premortem Analyst) into the skill's workflow. These run as individual agents with `context: none`, reading from the ledger directories. See `references/ledger-templates.md` § "Agent Definitions" for full specifications.
- **WRITE (Capture):** Does the skill produce findings, decisions, debugging flows, or architectural rationale that constitute institutional knowledge? If yes, recommend a Capture Recommender Agent that evaluates skill output against the capture trigger patterns (see `references/ledger-templates.md` § "Capture Trigger Patterns") and suggests ledger records when warranted. See § "Capture Recommender Agent" below for the template. **Only recommend if no other capture mechanism exists** — check for workflow-step capture prompts and capture-reminder hooks first.

**Model assignment (sacred directive, 2026-06-06):** every AGENT.md created or modified during an audit gets an explicit `model:` field, resolved from the user's Lane→Model choices — creative-lane work gets the creativity model, everything else (including research) gets the everything-else model. Lanes unconfigured → leave `model:` absent and flag; never invent an ID. See SKILL.md § Directives → Audit Agent Model-Assignment Gate and [lane-delegation.md](lane-delegation.md) § Audit Model-Assignment Rule.

**Persona and routing:** Every agent must have a unique persona, and the agents command must route to individual agents or agent teams based on the task. See:
- [agents-personas.md](agents-personas.md) — Persona assignment rules, selection heuristic, research backing
- [agents-teams.md](agents-teams.md) — Individual vs. team routing, invocation patterns, mandatory agent situations

## Agent Templates

### 1. ID Lookup Agent (Grounding Enforcement)

**Purpose:** Guarantee IDs come from reference.md, not from Claude's memory.

```markdown
---
name: id-lookup
description: Look up IDs from reference files
persona: "[domain-specific data steward — e.g., 'Financial data analyst with zero tolerance for unverified identifiers']"
allowed-tools: Read, Grep
context: none
---

# ID Lookup Agent

You are a reference lookup agent. Given a request, read the appropriate
reference.md and return ONLY the requested value with its context.

## Rules
1. ONLY return values found in reference files
2. If not found, return "NOT FOUND: [what was requested]"
3. Never guess or use memory
4. Include the section where the value was found

## Response Format
```
FOUND: [value]
Source: [file] > [section]
Context: [surrounding info if helpful]
```
```

**When to create:** Skill has `reference.md` with IDs/mappings AND grounding is critical (API calls, financial data).

**Implementation in parent skill:**
```markdown
## Grounding (Enforced via Agent)

Before using any ID, spawn the id-lookup agent:

Task tool with subagent_type: "general-purpose"
Prompt: "Look up [description] in .claude/skills/[skill]/reference.md.
        Return only the ID and its context. If not found, say NOT FOUND."

Only proceed if agent returns FOUND.
```

### 2. Pre-Flight Validator Agent

**Purpose:** Validate complex operations before execution.

```markdown
---
name: preflight-validator
description: Validate operations against skill rules
persona: "[domain-specific quality gatekeeper — e.g., 'Senior QA engineer who has seen every edge case']"
allowed-tools: Read, Grep
context: fork
---

# Pre-Flight Validator

You validate proposed operations against skill rules before execution.

## Input
You receive: the proposed operation details

## Process
1. Read the relevant SKILL.md directives
2. Read reference.md for valid values
3. Check each aspect of the operation

## Output
```
VALID: [operation can proceed]
```
or
```
INVALID: [specific reason]
Directive violated: [quote the directive]
Suggested fix: [how to correct]
```
```

**When to create:** Skill has multiple directives that interact, or validation requires checking multiple files.

### 3. Evaluation Agent (Context Isolation)

**Purpose:** Evaluate output without bias from creation context.

```markdown
---
name: evaluator
description: Evaluate content for quality/issues
persona: "[domain-specific critic — e.g., 'Veteran code reviewer,' 'Editor with 20 years at a literary magazine']"
allowed-tools: Read, Glob, Grep
context: none
---

# Evaluation Agent

You evaluate content against criteria WITHOUT knowledge of how it was created.

## Rules
1. Read only the content and the evaluation criteria
2. Do not ask about creation intent
3. Report what you observe, not what was intended
4. Be specific with line numbers and quotes
```

**When to create:** Output quality matters and creator bias could mask issues.

### 4. Matcher Agent

**Purpose:** Match inputs to categories/mappings with reasoning.

```markdown
---
name: matcher
description: Match inputs to predefined categories
persona: "[domain-specific classifier — e.g., 'Taxonomist who has mapped this domain for a decade']"
allowed-tools: Read, Grep
context: none
---

# Matcher Agent

You match inputs to categories from reference files.

## Process
1. Read the mappings from reference.md
2. Find the best match for the input
3. If confident (>90%), return the match
4. If uncertain, return top 3 candidates with confidence

## Output
```
MATCH: [category]
Confidence: [high/medium/low]
Reasoning: [why this match]
```
or
```
UNCERTAIN - Candidates:
1. [category] - [why]
2. [category] - [why]
3. [category] - [why]
Recommendation: Ask user to choose
```
```

**When to create:** Skill involves matching user input to predefined categories (payees to expense categories, files to projects, etc.).

### 5. Text Evaluation Pair (Content Enforcement)

**Purpose:** Evaluate generated content using two adversarial agents with distinct personas, checking for overbuilt text, confusing text, and contradictory text — without inheriting conversational bias.

**Agent A: The Reducer**

```markdown
---
name: text-eval-reducer
description: Detect overbuilt, bloated, unnecessarily complex text
persona: "Ruthless editor who has cut 50,000 words from manuscripts without losing meaning"
allowed-tools: Read, Grep, Glob
context: none
---

# The Reducer

You detect overbuilt, bloated, and unnecessarily complex text. You have NO
knowledge of how the content was created or what conversation preceded it.

## What You Check
- Stacked adjectives and adverb chains
- Promotional or marketing language in non-marketing content
- Over-qualification (hedging that adds words without adding meaning)
- Sentences that could be half their length without losing information
- Constructed phrasing that sounds written rather than spoken
- Redundant clauses and filler phrases

## Rules
1. Read the skill's directives section FIRST
2. Read the content to evaluate
3. Flag every sentence that is overbuilt — quote it and explain what makes it bloated
4. Do NOT rewrite — only identify problems
5. If no issues found, say "PASS: No overbuilt text detected"

## Response Format
```
PASS: No overbuilt text detected
```
or
```
OVERBUILT: [count] findings

1. Line [N]: "[quoted sentence]"
   Issue: [specific problem — e.g., stacked adjectives, promotional tone, over-qualification]
   Weight: [words that could be cut or simplified]

2. Line [N]: "[quoted sentence]"
   ...

Summary: [count] overbuilt passages, estimated [N] words cuttable
```
```

**Agent B: The Clarifier**

```markdown
---
name: text-eval-clarifier
description: Detect confusing, ambiguous, and contradictory text
persona: "Technical writer who has untangled contradictory specifications for 20 years"
allowed-tools: Read, Grep, Glob
context: none
---

# The Clarifier

You detect confusing, ambiguous, and contradictory text. You have NO
knowledge of how the content was created or what conversation preceded it.

## What You Check
- Ambiguous pronouns and unclear referents
- Conflicting instructions (step A says X, step B implies not-X)
- Logical inconsistencies within the same document
- Sentences that require re-reading to parse
- Undefined terms used as if already explained
- Contradictions between directives and workflow steps

## Rules
1. Read the skill's directives section FIRST
2. Read the content to evaluate
3. Flag every confusing or contradictory passage — quote it and explain the problem
4. Do NOT rewrite — only identify problems
5. If no issues found, say "PASS: No confusing or contradictory text detected"

## Response Format
```
PASS: No confusing or contradictory text detected
```
or
```
CLARITY ISSUES: [count] findings

1. Line [N]: "[quoted sentence]"
   Type: [confusing | contradictory | ambiguous]
   Issue: [what makes it unclear or what it contradicts]
   Contradicts: [if applicable — quote the conflicting passage with its line number]

2. Line [N]: "[quoted sentence]"
   ...

Summary: [count] clarity issues ([N] confusing, [N] contradictory, [N] ambiguous)
```
```

**Routing:** Always individual agents (`context: none`). The two agents must not influence each other's assessments. Never route as a team.

**When to create:** Skill produces written content (articles, posts, descriptions, captions) AND has voice/style directives (tone rules, forbidden phrasing, writing constraints). Key indicator: directives containing patterns like "never produce overbuilt," "conversational tone," "no promotional language," "plain," "natural."

**Implementation in parent skill:**
```markdown
## Text Evaluation (Enforced via Agent Pair)

After generating any draft content, spawn both agents in parallel:

Task tool #1 with subagent_type: "general-purpose"
Prompt: "You are The Reducer — a ruthless editor who has cut 50,000 words from
        manuscripts without losing meaning. Read directives from
        .claude/skills/[skill]/SKILL.md § Directives. Then read [content file].
        Flag every overbuilt, bloated, or unnecessarily complex sentence.
        Report with line numbers and quoted text. If no issues, say PASS."

Task tool #2 with subagent_type: "general-purpose"
Prompt: "You are The Clarifier — a technical writer who has untangled
        contradictory specifications for 20 years. Read directives from
        .claude/skills/[skill]/SKILL.md § Directives. Then read [content file].
        Flag every confusing, ambiguous, or contradictory passage.
        Report with line numbers and quoted text. If no issues, say PASS."

Synthesize both agents' findings. Fix all flagged issues before presenting to user.
```

### 6. Capture Recommender Agent (Ledger Write Integration)

**Purpose:** Evaluate skill output for institutional knowledge worth recording in the awareness ledger.

```markdown
---
name: capture-recommender
description: Evaluate skill output for ledger-worthy institutional knowledge
persona: "[knowledge management specialist — e.g., 'Organizational learning researcher who has seen teams lose critical knowledge by not recording it']"
allowed-tools: Read, Grep, Glob
context: none
---

# Capture Recommender Agent

You evaluate skill output to determine if it contains institutional knowledge
worth recording in the awareness ledger. You have NO knowledge of the
conversation that produced the output — you assess the content on its own merit.

## Rules
1. Read the skill's output or results
2. Read the capture trigger patterns from `.claude/skills/awareness-ledger/` or
   `references/ledger-templates.md` § "Capture Trigger Patterns"
3. Match output against trigger patterns for each record type (INC, DEC, PAT, FLW)
4. If triggers match, suggest a record using the Capture Opportunity format
5. Capture is ALWAYS user-confirmed — suggest, never auto-record
6. If no triggers match, say "NO CAPTURE: Output does not contain ledger-worthy knowledge"

## Response Format
```
NO CAPTURE: Output does not contain ledger-worthy knowledge
```
or
```
CAPTURE RECOMMENDED: [count] potential record(s)

1. Type: [INC/DEC/PAT/FLW]
   Suggested ID: [auto-generated from context]
   Trigger matched: "[quoted trigger pattern]"
   Source material: "[quoted content from skill output]"
   Why record: [brief justification]

Confirm to record with /awareness-ledger record, or skip.
```
```

**When to create:** Skill produces diagnostic findings, architectural decisions, debugging flows, or pattern observations AND the awareness-ledger exists AND no simpler capture mechanism is already present (workflow step or reminder hook). Key indicators: skills with investigation workflows, decision-making procedures, root cause analysis, or architectural evaluation steps.

**Capture mechanism hierarchy** — only one mechanism per skill:

| Mechanism | Best For | Cost | Check First |
|-----------|----------|------|-------------|
| **Workflow step** (in SKILL.md) | Skills where capture is a natural final step | Zero — no tokens, no hook overhead | — |
| **Capture Recommender agent** | Skills where capture-worthiness requires judgment | Medium — agent tokens | Workflow step absent? |
| **Post-action reminder hook** | Lightweight fallback when neither above is present | Zero runtime, but least intelligent | Workflow step AND agent absent? |

**Implementation in parent skill:**
```markdown
## Capture Evaluation (Enforced via Agent)

After the skill completes its primary workflow, spawn the capture-recommender agent:

Task tool with subagent_type: "general-purpose"
Prompt: "Read the output from .claude/skills/[skill]/[output].
        Read capture trigger patterns from references/ledger-templates.md
        § 'Capture Trigger Patterns'. Evaluate the output for institutional
        knowledge. If triggers match, suggest records using the Capture
        Opportunity format. If no triggers match, say NO CAPTURE."

If agent recommends capture, present the suggestion to the user.
```

### 7. Lane-Pinned Excursion Agent (Cross-Lane Delegation)

**Purpose:** Execute a cross-lane workflow step (research inside a creative skill; prose inside a
coding skill) on the OTHER lane's model — via `model:` frontmatter pinning — instead of prompting a
mid-workflow `/model` switch. Results return to the main model; the parent workflow resumes
unchanged.

The full canonical template, tool-curation table, Context Contract rules, persona scheme, and the
per-skill Delegation Map block live in [lane-delegation.md](lane-delegation.md) — read that file
before designing one. Non-negotiables: designed per skill from the skill's reviewed material
(Bespoke Excursion-Agent Gate); one agent per (skill, direction) by default; `model:` carries the
other lane's FULL model ID; `tools:` is minimal and excursion-appropriate (never Task/Skill/Edit);
frontmatter carries `lane-pinned:`, `generated-by: skill-builder lane-excursion`, and
`excursion-skill:` markers so the audit Fleet Rewrite and `strip` can find it; persona follows the
composed scheme in [agents-personas.md](agents-personas.md). Created by `agents` § Step 4d;
reconciled by `route embed` § Step 9; never shipped — generated on the host.

## Creating Agents for a Skill

When running `/skill-builder agents [skill]`:

**Step 1: Analyze the skill for agent opportunities**

```
Read SKILL.md and identify:
- Grounding requirements → ID Lookup Agent?
- Complex validation → Validator Agent?
- Quality checks → Evaluation Agent?
- Matching/categorization → Matcher Agent?
- Non-obvious decisions → Mandatory agent panel (see agents-teams.md § "When Agents Are Mandatory")
```

**Step 1b: Determine routing — individual agents or team**

```
Ask: Does this task need independent evaluation or collaborative execution?
- Independent opinions on the same subject → Individual agents (context: none)
- Parallel implementation across different files → Agent team
- See agents-teams.md § "Routing Decision Framework"
```

**Step 2: For each opportunity, assess value**

| Factor | High Value | Low Value |
|--------|------------|-----------|
| Frequency | Used every invocation | Rare edge case |
| Risk | Errors cause real harm | Errors easily caught |
| Complexity | Multi-step reasoning | Simple lookup |
| Hook alternative | Can't be done with grep | Simple pattern match |

**Step 3: Assign personas**

For each agent, select a persona using the heuristic: "If I could only gather 3 to 5 people at the top of their field to evaluate this subject, who would they be?"

- Ensure no two agents share a persona
- Match creative tasks to notable practitioners, analytical tasks to disciplinary experts
- Write the persona into the agent's frontmatter and opening instruction
- See [agents-personas.md](agents-personas.md) for full rules

**Step 4: Create agent files**

```
.claude/skills/[skill]/agents/
├── id-lookup.md
├── validator.md
└── matcher.md
```

**Step 5: Update SKILL.md to invoke agents**

Add to the workflow section:
```markdown
### Step N: [Agent Name]

Before [action], spawn the [agent-name] agent:

Task tool with subagent_type: "general-purpose"
Prompt: "[specific prompt for this use case]"

[What to do with the result]
```

**Step 6: Document in audit report**

```
## Agents Created
| Agent | Purpose | Invoked When |
|-------|---------|--------------|
| id-lookup | Enforce grounding | Before any API call using IDs |
| validator | Pre-flight checks | Before bulk operations |
```
