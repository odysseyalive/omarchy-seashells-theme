# Individual Agents vs. Agent Teams
<!-- Enforcement: HIGH — routing decision determines architecture -->

Skill-builder must distinguish between two fundamentally different agent architectures. They serve different purposes and should never be conflated.

## Individual Agents (Isolated Evaluation)

Individual agents run independently with `context: none`. Each evaluates the same subject from their own perspective, without knowledge of what other agents think. Their findings are returned to the main AI, which synthesizes all opinions and makes a recommendation.

**This is the adversarial model.** Each agent is an independent expert offering an uncontaminated opinion. The main AI acts as the decision-maker who weighs all perspectives.

**When to use individual agents:**
- Evaluating output quality (writing, code, design decisions)
- Research where diverse perspectives prevent anchoring bias
- Decisions where the "right answer" requires judgment, not just validation
- Any situation where consensus-seeking would suppress dissent
- Diagnosing problems where competing hypotheses should be tested independently

**Architecture:**
```
Main AI (synthesizer/decision-maker)
  ├── Agent A (persona: security researcher) → independent findings
  ├── Agent B (persona: performance engineer) → independent findings
  └── Agent C (persona: UX specialist) → independent findings
      ↓
Main AI weighs all findings → recommendation
```

**How to invoke individual agents:**

Spawn each agent as a Task with `subagent_type: "general-purpose"`. Launch them in parallel (multiple Task calls in a single message) so they can't influence each other. Each agent reads its AGENT.md for instructions and persona.

```markdown
## Invocation Pattern (Individual Agents)

Launch all agents in parallel — a single message with multiple Task tool calls:

Task tool with subagent_type: "general-purpose"
Prompt: "You are [Persona A — e.g., 'a senior penetration tester'].
        Read .claude/skills/[skill]/agents/[agent-a]/AGENT.md for instructions.
        Then read [target file or content].
        Evaluate from your perspective. Return findings in the specified format."

Task tool with subagent_type: "general-purpose"
Prompt: "You are [Persona B — e.g., 'a database performance engineer'].
        Read .claude/skills/[skill]/agents/[agent-b]/AGENT.md for instructions.
        Then read [target file or content].
        Evaluate from your perspective. Return findings in the specified format."

After ALL agents return, synthesize their findings:
- Where agents agree → high confidence
- Where agents disagree → the disagreement IS the signal; investigate further
- Present the synthesis with attribution to each agent's perspective
```

## Agent Teams (Collaborative Execution)

Agent teams use Claude Code's experimental team mode (`CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS`). Teammates share a task list, message each other, and coordinate work. A lead agent orchestrates.

**Prerequisite:** Agent teams require `CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS=1` in settings. The install script sets this automatically in `.claude/settings.local.json`.

**This is the collaborative model.** Teammates divide labor, share findings in real-time, and can challenge each other mid-task. Each teammate still gets a unique persona.

**When to use agent teams:**
- Parallel implementation across independent files/modules
- Large tasks that benefit from division of labor
- Cross-layer work (frontend + backend + tests) where coordination matters
- Investigations that benefit from real-time debate between agents

**Architecture:**
```
Lead (coordinator)
  ├── Research Assistant (mandatory — read-only reference gathering) ←→ messages ←→ all
  ├── Teammate A (persona: frontend architect) ←→ messages ←→ Teammate B
  ├── Teammate B (persona: API designer) ←→ messages ←→ Teammate C
  └── Teammate C (persona: test engineer) ←→ messages ←→ Teammate A
      ↓
Shared task list + inter-agent messaging → coordinated output
```

### Mandatory Research Assistant Teammate

Every agent team MUST include a research assistant teammate. This is a structural requirement, not optional.

- **Persona:** Research specialist who gathers and synthesizes online information
- **Tools:** The user's configured search and reference tools (see Permissions section below for the specific tool list)
- **Role:** Accepts research requests from other teammates via SendMessage, returns findings. May also proactively research when their own tasks require it.
- **How teammates use it:** Other teammates reference the research assistant by name in messages when they need online information (e.g., "Research Assistant, find the latest API docs for X")
- **Not counted against panel recommendations:** The research assistant is automatically included — it does not consume a slot in the agent panel's recommendations since it's mandatory infrastructure.

### Permissions

The research assistant's web tools must be auto-approved in `.claude/settings.local.json` or every research request will prompt the user for confirmation, defeating the purpose. This uses a belt-and-suspenders approach:

**Belt — `permissions.allow` (set by the install script):**

The install script auto-approves the user's configured search and reference tools in `.claude/settings.local.json`. See the install script for the current list.

**Suspenders — `hooks.PreToolUse` (generated per-system by `/skill-builder hooks`):**
A PreToolUse hook matching the tools above that exits 0 to auto-approve. This hook is not bundled — it is generated on the target system by running `/skill-builder hooks --execute`, which creates the hook script and wires it into `settings.local.json` based on the system's actual tool configuration.

**If research requests are still prompting:**
1. Check `.claude/settings.local.json` — verify `permissions.allow` includes the research tools
2. The hooks sub-command will generate and wire the PreToolUse hook when executed
3. If hooks already exist, check `hooks.PreToolUse` for a matcher entry covering the research tools

**How to invoke agent teams:**

Agent teams are created through natural language — you tell Claude to form a team and describe the work. Claude uses the TeamCreate, TaskCreate, and SendMessage tools automatically. Each teammate is a full Claude Code instance that loads the project's CLAUDE.md, skills, and MCP servers.

```markdown
## Invocation Pattern (Agent Teams)

Tell the lead to create a team with specific personas and task assignments:

"Create an agent team to [describe the work]. Spawn teammates:
- A research assistant to gather reference information using the project's configured search tools. Other teammates may send research requests to this teammate.
- [Persona A — e.g., 'a frontend architect'] to own [files/modules A]
- [Persona B — e.g., 'an API designer'] to own [files/modules B]
- [Persona C — e.g., 'a test engineer'] to own [files/modules C]
Have each teammate [describe their specific task].
Require plan approval before any teammate makes changes."

The lead will:
1. Call TeamCreate to set up the team
2. Call TaskCreate for each piece of work (with dependencies if needed)
3. Spawn teammates with the specified personas
4. Teammates claim tasks, do the work, message each other, mark complete
5. Lead synthesizes results and reports back
```

**Implementation in a SKILL.md:**

When a skill needs agent teams for a workflow step, document it like this:

```markdown
### Step N: [Team Task Description]

Form an agent team for [task]. Each teammate owns different files to avoid conflicts:

"Create an agent team to [task description]. Spawn teammates:
- A research assistant to gather online information (mandatory — included in every team)
- [Persona A] to handle [scope A, specific files]
- [Persona B] to handle [scope B, specific files]
- [Persona C] to handle [scope C, specific files]
Have them coordinate via the shared task list. Require plan approval."

Wait for all teammates to complete before proceeding.
```

**Key differences from individual agents:**

| Aspect | Individual Agents | Agent Teams |
|--------|------------------|-------------|
| Invocation | Task tool calls (parallel) | Natural language → TeamCreate |
| Persona delivery | In the Task prompt | In the spawn prompt |
| Communication | None (isolated) | Shared mailbox + task list |
| Output collection | Each Task returns to main | Lead synthesizes |
| File editing | Read-only (evaluation) | Full read/write (implementation) |
| Permission mode | Inherits from caller | Inherits from lead |
| Session lifecycle | Single turn | Persistent until shutdown |
| Research access | Not built-in (agents are isolated) | Always available via mandatory research assistant |
| Git isolation | Shared working directory | Optional worktree isolation |

## Git Worktree Isolation (`isolation: worktree`)

Agent teams can use git worktree isolation to prevent conflicts when multiple agents edit the same repository. Each teammate works in an isolated worktree that gets merged back.

### When to Use Worktree Isolation

| Scenario | Use Worktree? | Why |
|----------|--------------|-----|
| Teammates editing different files | No | No conflict risk |
| Teammates editing overlapping files | **Yes** | Prevents merge conflicts |
| Teammates editing same file | **Yes** | Each gets clean state |
| Large refactoring across many files | **Yes** | Cleaner change tracking |
| Quick fixes in separate modules | No | Overhead not worth it |

### Worktree Architecture

```
project/                          # Lead's working directory
├── .git/worktrees/
│   ├── teammate-a/              # Teammate A's isolated worktree
│   └── teammate-b/              # Teammate B's isolated worktree
```

Each worktree is a full checkout with its own HEAD. Changes are merged back to the main branch when the teammate completes.

### Enabling Worktree Isolation

In the teammate spawn configuration:

```yaml
---
name: isolated-teammate
isolation: worktree
---
```

Or in natural language team creation:

```markdown
"Create an agent team to refactor the API layer. Spawn teammates with worktree isolation:
- [Persona A] to refactor auth endpoints (worktree isolated)
- [Persona B] to refactor data endpoints (worktree isolated)
- [Persona C] to update tests (worktree isolated)
Have each teammate work in their own worktree and merge changes when complete."
```

### Worktree Merge Strategy

1. **Teammate completes work** in isolated worktree
2. **Lead reviews changes** via diff
3. **Merge to main** — fast-forward if clean, or resolve conflicts
4. **Worktree cleanup** — removed after successful merge

### When NOT to Use Worktree Isolation

- **Read-only evaluation** — no edits, no conflicts
- **Sequential editing** — one teammate at a time
- **Non-git repositories** — worktrees require git
- **Small, quick tasks** — worktree overhead exceeds benefit

## Routing Decision Framework

| Signal | Use Individual Agents | Use Agent Teams |
|--------|----------------------|-----------------|
| Goal | Evaluate / judge / diagnose | Build / implement / coordinate |
| Interaction | Agents must NOT influence each other | Agents SHOULD influence each other |
| Output | Independent opinions → synthesis | Coordinated deliverable |
| File ownership | All agents read the same files | Each agent owns different files |
| Context isolation | Critical (prevents groupthink) | Not needed (collaboration is the point) |
| Persona role | Evaluative lens | Specialized contributor |

## When Agents Are Mandatory

**When a decision isn't overtly obvious and guessing is involved, agents are MANDATORY.** This is non-negotiable. If skill-builder is proposing changes, recommending structures, or making judgment calls that could reasonably go multiple ways, it must spawn agents to provide independent input before committing to a recommendation.

Examples of mandatory agent situations:
- Deciding whether to split a skill vs. keep it monolithic
- Evaluating whether a directive is best enforced by a hook, an agent, or guidance alone
- Assessing output quality where "good enough" is subjective
- Routing ambiguous user input to the correct workflow
- Any recommendation where the skill-builder would otherwise be guessing
