## Shell-Safety Command Procedure

**Write and audit shell code (scripts, hook commands, JSON-embedded shell) for portability and resilience pitfalls.**

This procedure is the canonical rule set for any shell code generated or audited by skill-builder (hooks, verify, etc.) or by other skills via `/skill-builder shell-safety …`. It replaces the legacy standalone `shell-safety` skill — the rules, templates, and audit patterns are now co-located here so skill-builder's subsystems have a single source of truth.

## Usage

```
/skill-builder shell-safety [mode] [path]
```

### Modes

| Mode | Command | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `write` | `/skill-builder shell-safety write [target]` | Generate a new script or JSON shell entry from a template with safe defaults baked in |
| `audit` | `/skill-builder shell-safety audit [path]` | Scan a file or directory for the documented pitfalls. Display findings; with `--execute`, patch the mechanical-safe ones |
| `lint` | `/skill-builder shell-safety lint [file]` | Read-only single-file check. Useful as a pre-write or pre-commit step |

Default mode is `lint` if a single file is passed, `audit` if a directory is passed.

## Scoped Design Constraints

These apply within this procedure's rewrite and audit workflows — they are not global skill-builder directives.

- **"Auto-fix only the mechanical, deterministic patches. Flag the judgment-based ones for human review. A wrong silent rewrite is worse than a noisy report."**
- **"Never strip a security check, defensive guard, or error path during a rewrite. If the original code was overly cautious, that is information about its author's intent — preserve it."**

## What This Covers

The pitfall classes — see [../shell-safety/rules.md](../shell-safety/rules.md) for the full list with rationale and bad/good examples:

| Class | What goes wrong |
|-------|-----------------|
| **Path resolution** | Bare relative paths in hook commands or scripts that assume CWD |
| **Path-with-spaces** | Unquoted variable expansions that split when expanded path contains whitespace |
| **Crash visibility** | Hook scripts without ERR traps; failures vanish into "non-blocking status code" noise |
| **`set -e` foot-guns** | Pipelines, conditionals, and ERR traps that don't behave as written |
| **Stdin parsing** | `$(cat)` without fallback; assumes stdin is JSON-shaped |
| **Tool dependence** | `jq`, `python3`, GNU-specific flags assumed available |
| **Grep pitfalls** | Unanchored patterns, missing `2>/dev/null`, `-q` exit code reliance without guard |
| **JSON-embedded shell** | settings.json command strings; quoting rules differ from script bodies |

---

## Workflow: Write

Generate a new script, hook command, or shell snippet with safe defaults pre-applied.

1. **Identify the target shape** — standalone script (`.sh`), hook command string (in JSON), inline tool invocation, or one-off Bash tool call
2. **Read the matching template** from [../shell-safety/templates.md](../shell-safety/templates.md)
3. **Customize the template** — replace placeholders with caller-specific logic. Keep the boilerplate (header comment, ERR trap, defensive stdin) intact.
4. **Validate before returning** — run a smoke test invocation if the script is standalone; for JSON entries, parse the surrounding JSON to confirm validity

---

## Workflow: Audit

Scan one or more files for documented pitfalls.

1. **Identify scan surface** — single file, a directory, or a glob pattern. If `path` is `.claude/settings*.json`, scan JSON command strings. If `.sh`, scan script bodies. If a directory, walk both classes.
2. **Run detection patterns** from [../shell-safety/audit-patterns.md](../shell-safety/audit-patterns.md) — each pattern returns line-level matches with severity (HARD = mechanical fix, SOFT = needs judgment) and the recommended remediation
3. **Classify findings:**
   - **Auto-fixable (mechanical)** — path quoting, `$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR` wrapping, missing `2>/dev/null` on fallible operations
   - **Flag for review (judgment)** — adding ERR traps to existing scripts, removing `set -e`, restructuring stdin parsing
4. **Display report** grouped by file. Show: line, pattern matched, severity, recommended fix.
5. **In `--execute` mode:** apply the auto-fixable patches. Back up each modified file as `[name].bak`. Validate after each rewrite (JSON parses, script still has correct shebang, etc.). Leave flag-only findings in the report for the user to address.

---

## Workflow: Lint

Read-only single-file check. Same detection logic as audit, no remediation.

1. **Read the file**
2. **Run detection patterns** from [../shell-safety/audit-patterns.md](../shell-safety/audit-patterns.md)
3. **Return findings** as a compact summary: `[file]: N findings (H hard, S soft)`. Exit 0 if none, exit 1 if findings present (so it composes with `&&` chains and pre-commit invocations).

---

## Grounding

Before writing, auditing, or remediating shell:

1. Read the relevant section of [../shell-safety/rules.md](../shell-safety/rules.md) for the pitfall class in question
2. State: "I will use [PATTERN/TEMPLATE] from references/shell-safety/[file] under [SECTION]"

Reference files:

- [../shell-safety/rules.md](../shell-safety/rules.md) — Canonical pitfall list with rationale and bad/good examples
- [../shell-safety/templates.md](../shell-safety/templates.md) — Script and JSON-embedded shell scaffolds with safe defaults
- [../shell-safety/audit-patterns.md](../shell-safety/audit-patterns.md) — Detection regexes, severity classification, mechanical vs judgment patches

---

## Integration with Other Skill-Builder Procedures

- **Hook generation** ([hooks.md](hooks.md)): call `write` for the target shape; do not hand-roll boilerplate
- **Pre-write validation** (any procedure emitting shell): call `lint` before writing to disk
- **Audit** ([hooks.md](hooks.md), [verify.md](verify.md)): call `audit` and merge findings into the caller's report

This keeps the rule set in one place. When a new pitfall is discovered, add it to `../shell-safety/rules.md` once; every consumer benefits without per-procedure changes.
