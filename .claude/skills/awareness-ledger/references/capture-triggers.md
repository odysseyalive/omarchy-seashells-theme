# Capture Trigger Patterns

Conversation signals that suggest a record should be created.

## Incident Triggers
- Rollback or revert language: "roll back," "revert," "undo," "broke," "regression"
- Error investigation: "root cause," "why did this," "what went wrong"
- Post-fix reflection: "that was caused by," "the fix was," "lesson learned"

## Decision Triggers
- Choice justification: "I chose X because," "we should use X instead of Y"
- Trade-off discussion: "the trade-off is," "downside of this approach"
- Architecture language: "going forward," "from now on," "the pattern should be"

## Pattern Triggers
- Repeated observation: "this keeps happening," "every time we," "I've noticed"
- Rule discovery: "turns out," "the trick is," "what works is"
- Exception identification: "except when," "doesn't apply to," "unless"

## Flow Triggers
- Step-by-step debugging: "first it does X, then Y, then Z"
- User behavior description: "when the user does X," "the flow is"
- Environment-specific: "only happens when," "requires X to be running"

**Capture is always user-confirmed.** Agents suggest, user decides.
